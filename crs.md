# CRS Infrastructure

This repository contains the infrastructure for building, running, and ensembling Continuous Reasoning Systems (CRSs) as a demonstration of bug-finding capabilities.

## Implemented Features

- Basic workflow for building, running, and ensembling CRSs
- Automated LiteLLM server deployment during CRS operations
- YAML-based configuration for CPU core allocation, memory limits, and LLM budget control

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Team-Atlanta/oss-fuzz-post-aixcc
```

### 2. Configure API Key

Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. The key can be a placeholder value (e.g., `sk-fake-key`), but the variable must be set for the system to run:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-fake-key
```

Note: Most CRSs in this demo have minimal or zero OpenAI API quota usage.

### 3. Build a CRS

Choose a configured CRS from `infra/crs/example_configs` and build it:

```bash
# Example: Build ensemble-c for the json-c project
python3 infra/helper.py build_crs infra/crs/example_configs/ensemble-c json-c
```

Built artifacts will be available under `build/crs` and `build/out`.

### 4. Run a Built CRS

Execute a built CRS with a specific fuzzer target:

```bash
python3 infra/helper.py run_crs infra/crs/example_configs/ensemble-c json-c json_array_fuzzer
```

**Expected Output**: The CRS will launch successfully with running logs showing CPU core allocation (base numbers 0-15). For ensemble CRSs, CPU cores are evenly distributed among the contained CRSs.

## Supported CRSs

- **`atlantis-c-libafl`** - LibAFL-based Atlantis-C for C projects
- **`crs-libfuzzer`** - Vanilla libFuzzer as a reference CRS implementation
- **`atlantis-java-main`** - Atlantis-Java with LLM components enabled
- **`atlantis-java-atljazzer`** - Atlantis-Java with fuzzer-only mode (no LLM)
- **`ensemble-c`** - Ensemble combining `atlantis-c-libafl` and `crs-libfuzzer`
- **`ensemble-java`** - Ensemble combining `atlantis-java-main` and `atlantis-java-atljazzer`

- `.env` - Environment variables for database and LiteLLM configuration
- YAML configuration files for resource allocation and CRS-specific settings
